### What I learned
In this project I was able to learn about over all concepts of CSS which has margin, padding. 
I was confident with selectors and colors at first and then understood margin, padding and rounded corners.
 

### Continued development
I want to learn more about the CSS media queries. In this current code when I resize the web page, the content of element <p> is getting spilled out from the white background.
So, I want to know more on how I can keep the content intact inside the white box.
### Useful resources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries -- I checked this to understand about media query.
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/ for the basic margins, padding and box model.
